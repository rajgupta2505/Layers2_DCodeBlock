DECODEBLOCK :-

'We are a web3 education platform providing education through code-writing and solving the second largest crisis in the blockchain market'

```
We are solving the Essential Crisis in the Blockchain Industry (ie. Skill GAP) through interactive learning, theme-based real-world coding challenges, and Exciting Contests and Project Collaboration through our Community. We are the only company providing a first-hand online judging resource for blockchain education and providing incentives to developers through our inbuilt token economics.

A large existential problem looms in the complex web3 and blockchain world. A lack of developer friendly resources helping them embrace this wonderful industry. Also,web3 companies have provided a consensus gentium of lack of required skills in existing web3 developers to scale newer innovation.
